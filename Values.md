## Core Values (draft)

There are some values we hold, which form the foundation on which we perform work and conduct ourselves with each other. 

These are our core values at Makkajai. These aren't new - most of these should be recognizable. Some of these also manifest themselves in our work or hiring principles. However, this is the starting point, and if anything is in conflict with this, we need to revise it. 


- Honesty
- Ownership
- Get Things Done
- Discipline
- Collaborative
- Learnability


Some examples below to explain what each of these would mean in our daily working lives. 



**Honesty**

- Truthful, trustworthy in all your dealings. Avoiding malice, or manipulative behaviors. 
- Does not shift blame. Accepts responsibilities for actions, even mistakes, especially when you have messed 
- Openness to look at things without bias. 
- Transparency; willingness to share unpopular (but honest) opinions or even sharing things that could be improved, for the greater good. Not holding back honest feedback when you know it will help others. 
- Respecting and encouraging honesty in others. 
- Honesty is not an excuse to be rude or abrasive, or make personally insulting comments on others. Use your judgement. 


**Ownership** 

- Cares as much as the owner would. 
- Taking full responsibility for goals and doing whatever is needed to achieve those. 
- No need to constantly follow up with you on things you have committed to achieve. 
- Willing to go out of the way, whenever really needed, for the sake of work. Having the judgement to know "when it is really needed". 
 

**Get things done** 

- Ability to achieve things, even when the exact way to do those things are not known upfront. 
- Figuring things out
- Taking something from just an idea to actually getting something concrete achieved. 
- Can own goals directly, and figure out the actions needed to hit those goals and also get them done. 
- Includes things that can be done individually, but also things that might need other people's help. 
- "Haven't done this before" is never an excuse. 

	
**Discipline**

- Respects own and others' time. Joins meetings on time, ends them on time, prepares for the meetings upfront, giving full attention, etc. 
- Able to carve out 40 hours a week on average, for work, even with all the flexibility. 
- Does the hard introspection, whenever not hitting the 40 hours per week, and also when having to overwork. 
- Plan things upfront, so that we don't waste time unnecessarily when executing. 
- Diligent in following some things that are important to us, like Basecamp checkins, standups, using Basecamp more than Slack, and so on. 
- Maintains a productive remote-work environment, free from distractions, enables flow. 


**Collaborative**

- Team before individuals. 
- Eliciting and encouraging best ideas regardless of who it comes from. (and especially when they don't come from you). 
- Active listening
- Framing the problem statements clearly so that it is easier for others to contribute potential solutions. 
- Judgement to involve the right people at the right time. 

	For example, 12 people to decide a shade of color on a design is not collaboration. 

	But involving all 4 people already working on one of the apps, to identify how to make a mechanic in that app less confusing, is collaboration.
- Collaboration does not mean every decision needs a consensus. 


**Learnability** 

- Willingness and ability to pick up new skills and get better at existing skills. 
- Not intimidated by the fear of unknown. 
- Uses the right tool for the right job, even if have to learn the new tool. Don't use a hammer to put in a screw, just because you know how to use a hammer. 
- Always excited by learning something new, even if having to put in some effort to actually do it. 
- Growth mindset - always believes that skills can be learnt, with enough effort and time, both themselves and others. 
- Has a habit of continuously learning something or the other - whether by reading, doing a course, or even just dabbling in things outside of immediate responsibilities.
